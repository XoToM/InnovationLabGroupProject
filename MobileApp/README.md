- Expo guide. Expo is a set of tools and libraries for developing react native apps. We will be using it for things like debugging, hot reload, and possibly the user interface. It also provides a bunch of useful libraries we might use in the future. Also haven't read through it yet, but is also probably worth reading https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/
